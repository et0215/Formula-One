# Formula-One

The project focuses on developing a comprehensive Formula 1 dashboard aimed at providing users with an intuitive and interactive platform to explore and analyze F1 data. Motivated by the challenge posed by the vast amount of Formula 1 data available and the lack of centralized visualizations, the objective is to create a valuable resource for fans, analysts, journalists, and teams alike. The project follows a structured approach encompassing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dashboard planning, and visualization. Basic data cleaning tasks are initially conducted using Excel, with SQL utilized for more complex data manipulation. Exploratory data analysis involves univariate analysis to uncover insights into the datasets, guiding subsequent visualization efforts.  Tableau and R serve as primary tools for data visualization, facilitating the creation of interactive visualizations to effectively communicate insights. Data is sourced from Kaggle, comprising 14 CSV files spanning Formula 1 races, drivers, and related metrics from the 1950 season to 2023. The project on GitHub aims to deliver a user-friendly and informative dashboard that enhances understanding and analysis of Formula 1 data.
